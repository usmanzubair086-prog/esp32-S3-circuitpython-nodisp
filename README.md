ESP32-S3 by Tenstar offers TFT, BMP280 and QMI8658C all in a one single SOC package. It's based on Adafruit's Feather line of boards having an onboard ESP32-S3 chip with PSRAM and a TFT screen on boot. I recently got one which as of now turns out has a bricked display.

This document recounts my experience working with a Tenstar ESP32-S3 board, which closely mimics the design and functionality of the Adafruit Feather line, including its integrated TFT display. While the small form factor is excellent for portable IoT projects, I immediately faced a significant challenge: the integrated display appeared either physically damaged or suffered from a persistent hardware anomaly, resulting in visual glitches and initialization failures that persisted despite rigorous software debugging attempts. Since the display was unreliable, the strategy shifted to ensuring the device operated effectively in a headless (display-off) mode to maximize both stability and battery life. For the purposes of this repository, the provided Python scripts (code.py) include a necessary optimization routine that executes immediately upon startup to disable the display hardware, ensuring the system operates reliably with minimal power draw. This is achieved through a two-part process: first, displayio.release_displays() is executed to free up critical RAM resources held by the software driver, and second, the board.TFT_BACKLIGHT pin is explicitly driven LOW (backlight.value = False). This action physically turns off the display's backlight, achieving maximum power efficiency and preventing interference from the faulty component.

My experience strongly leads me to recommend CircuitPython for development, as it offers a significantly more efficient and user-friendly experience compared to the traditional Arduino IDE, especially when dealing with nuanced hardware issues. The core benefit lies in library dependency management: all necessary drivers for components like IMUs, sensors, and NeoPixels are hosted on a single, centralized resource at the Official CircuitPython Libraries: https://circuitpython.org/libraries. To integrate any driver, one simply copies the library folder (e.g., neopixel, adafruit_qmi8658) into the board's root /lib directory after flashing the CircuitPython firmware; this eliminates the manual compilation and linking required by other environments. Furthermore, the development cycle itself is streamlined: unlike the Arduino IDE, which often requires code compilation, upload, pressing the reset button (which disconnects the board), re-identifying the port, and manually entering boot mode, CircuitPython allows the user to edit the code.py file directly on the mounted CIRCUITPY drive using an IDE like Thonny. Saving the file triggers an instantaneous soft-reboot, executing the new code immediately while the serial terminal remains connected and active, providing vital real-time debugging output. This direct, file-based workflow drastically speeds up iteration and reduces the operational hassle associated with physical board interaction. It is important to note that aside from the problematic display, the rest of the board's embedded peripherals—such as the on-board IMU, NeoPixel, and I2C/SPI interfaces—function reliably and robustly when provided with the correct CircuitPython libraries and initialization routines.
